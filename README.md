PlayMusic Suite lets you download your playlists from Google Music to import them into other programs like iTunes, Serato DJ and others.

I submitted this "feature" to Google as a bug report, but they responded by telling me it's supposed to work this way so have fun downloading your music! :)

## Features

- Download your Google Play Music playlists as MP3 files
- ID3 metadata will be automatically added, if detected
